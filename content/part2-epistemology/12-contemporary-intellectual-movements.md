# Chapter 12: Contemporary Intellectual Movements — Allies, Critiques, and Synthesis

## The Landscape We Inhabit

The theology I am building does not exist in an intellectual vacuum. It emerges from a specific moment -- the early 2020s -- when multiple intellectual communities are grappling with overlapping problems from different angles, each achieving genuine insight in its domain while remaining blind to what the others see. The communities I am about to survey are where the theology's early audience lives. Some of these people are potential allies. Some are potential critics. Most are both. Engaging honestly with each -- acknowledging genuine convergence, articulating precise divergence, and showing where the synthesis goes further than any component -- is not diplomatic strategy. It is an intellectual obligation. If the framework cannot account for these movements' achievements and address their blindnesses, it is not the synthesis it claims to be.

A note on tone: I am going to be direct, and directness will sometimes sound arrogant. When I say "what the theology offers them," I am not claiming superiority. I am claiming that a synthesis has structural advantages over its components. The rationalists have epistemological tools I do not match. The effective altruists have institutional infrastructure I do not match. The behavioral economists have empirical depth I do not match. What I am attempting is a *framework* that integrates insights they have produced independently. Whether the framework succeeds is for the reader to judge. But the attempt must be stated clearly rather than hedged into meaninglessness.

## The Rationality Community

The LessWrong community -- Eliezer Yudkowsky, Scott Alexander, the broader "rationalsphere" -- is the theology's closest intellectual cousin, and the engagement must therefore be the most careful.

### The Convergences

The convergences are substantial and non-trivial. Their project -- systematically identifying and correcting cognitive biases -- is Popperian epistemology applied to individual cognition. Their concept of "noticing confusion" -- the practice of flagging the moment when your model fails to predict reality, rather than explaining the failure away -- is Boyd's entropy detection formalized as a personal discipline. Their "double crux" method -- finding the empirical claim that would change both parties' minds -- is Pearlian causal reasoning applied to argumentation, cutting through rhetoric to identify the actual causal beliefs driving disagreement. Their calibration training -- learning to assign accurate probabilities to beliefs -- is the quantitative hygiene that any serious epistemic community requires.

I have learned from these people. The habit of asking "what would I expect to observe if I were wrong?" before investigating any claim is a rationalist practice that has prevented me from constructing elaborate justifications on at least a dozen occasions. I owe intellectual debts here.

### What the Theology Offers: Telos

The rationalist community has epistemology but no direction. They have built the most sophisticated toolkit for *how to think clearly* that the contemporary intellectual landscape has produced. They have not addressed -- and in many cases have explicitly refused to address -- the question of *what to think about clearly* and *why it matters*.

The result is a community of extraordinarily intelligent people who can optimize expected utility functions but cannot agree on what utility means, who can detect bias in reasoning but have no framework for the values the reasoning should serve, who can calibrate probabilities with admirable precision but have no orientation toward which probabilities actually matter. The Riemann sphere gives them the missing dimension: not just clear thinking but *directed* clear thinking. Not just rationality but rationality in service of the approach toward infinity.

### The Deeper Critique: Propositionalism

The theology's more fundamental critique cuts deeper than the missing telos. Rationalism, as practiced in the LessWrong community, is *entirely propositional*. It treats all knowledge as expressible in propositions, all reasoning as expressible in formal logic or Bayesian updates, all wisdom as reducible to correct beliefs held with appropriate confidence levels.

The theology argues -- through Pirsig's Quality, through the Gestalt tradition's insistence on pre-rational awareness, through the flow research of Parvizi-Wayne and Friston, through Kirill's observations about dance and embodied joy -- that there are forms of knowledge that propositional reasoning cannot access. The mystic's perception, the artist's intuition, the embodied knowledge that the dancer has and the spectator lacks, the quality-perception that Pirsig identifies as prior to subject-object division -- these are not failed propositions waiting to be formalized. They are knowledge in a different register, and a community that recognizes only propositional knowledge is a community with a systematic blind spot.

In Iain McGilchrist's terms: the rationality community is extremely sophisticated left-hemisphere cognition that has neglected the right hemisphere. Brilliant, precise, analytically powerful -- and systematically incapable of perceiving what the right hemisphere perceives: context, gestalt, embodied meaning, the whole that is more than the sum of parts.

### Moloch

I must address Scott Alexander's "Meditations on Moloch," because it is the most important essay the rationality community has produced and it converges almost perfectly with the theology's diagnosis.

Alexander's Moloch is the coordination failure that produces collectively irrational outcomes from individually rational behavior. The arms race. The tragedy of the commons. The race to the bottom in labor standards, environmental protection, media integrity. Each individual actor is behaving rationally -- optimizing their own expected utility -- and the collective outcome is catastrophic. The system is not stupid. It is not malicious. It is *structurally captured* by game-theoretic dynamics that no individual actor can escape.

In the theology's language: Moloch IS the antichrist structure. Not a person or a conspiracy but a structural pattern in which individual rationality aggregates into collective catastrophe. The psycho-class did not design the system. They are simply the actors whose optimization function aligns most naturally with the system's extractive dynamics. The normie's tragedy is not stupidity but the fact that normie cognition -- optimized for cooperation within existing structures -- cannot perceive the structural capture until it is too late.

And the Christ-event -- the apostolic intervention -- is precisely the anti-Moloch: a move that breaks the game-theoretic logic by acting on a principle the system says is irrational. Turning the other cheek, loving your enemy, sacrificing for strangers -- these are *irrational* within the game that Moloch defines. But they are rational within the larger topology, because they break the cycle of defection that Moloch depends on. The prophetic function is the capacity to see the game from outside, and the apostolic function is the willingness to play a different game even when the system punishes you for it.

The rationalists got the diagnosis right. They do not yet have the theology to generate the response.

## Effective Altruism

Effective Altruism (EA) is the rationalist community's practical arm, and its engagement with the theology is both simpler and more uncomfortable.

### The Genuine Advance

EA's core innovation is simple and powerful: measure the outcomes of charitable interventions, not just the intentions. Scope (how many people affected), neglectedness (is this area already well-funded?), tractability (can we actually make progress?) -- these criteria represent a genuine advance in philanthropic thinking. The tradition of charitable giving that measures success by the warmth of the giver's feelings rather than the wellbeing of the recipient is a tradition the theology should join EA in critiquing. Popperian norms demand empirical evaluation of hypotheses, including hypotheses about what helps people.

EA's warrior function -- the capacity to actually organize resources and deploy them against measurable targets -- is something the theology currently lacks and needs. The theology can diagnose the male loneliness crisis, the meaning crisis, the climate crisis. EA can actually run an intervention and measure whether it worked. This operational capacity deserves respect.

### The Utilitarian Foundation

But EA rests on a utilitarian philosophical foundation, and utilitarianism is a *correlational* ethic. It looks at outcomes -- the aggregate hedonic balance, the expected utility calculation -- without asking about the *causal structure* that generates those outcomes.

In Pearlian terms: EA mostly operates at Levels 1 and 2. "This intervention correlates with improved health outcomes" (Level 1). "If we distribute bednets, malaria rates decrease" (Level 2). These are genuine and valuable contributions. But EA rarely asks the Level 3 question: "What systemic structure *causes* the conditions that make bednets necessary in the first place, and what would the world look like if that structure were different?"

This is not a minor philosophical quibble. It is the difference between treating symptoms indefinitely and addressing causes. EA can calculate that distributing bednets saves more quality-adjusted life years per dollar than almost any other intervention. This is correct at Level 2. At Level 3, the question becomes: what causal structure maintains the global inequality that makes bednet distribution a more cost-effective intervention than structural reform? And the Level 3 answer implicates the same extractive dynamics -- the antichrist structure at global scale -- that the theology identifies as the systemic problem the apostolic task must address.

### The SBF Crisis

The Sam Bankman-Fried catastrophe is not an incidental scandal but a diagnostic case study that the normie/psycho/schizo framework explains with clinical precision.

SBF was a textbook psychopath operating within EA's utilitarian framework as camouflage. His stated philosophy -- "earn to give," maximize expected value, the ends justify the means because the utilitarian calculus says so -- was indistinguishable from sincere EA commitment. The community's trust architecture, optimized for cooperating normies, could not detect a psychopath speaking their own language fluently. There was no schizo detection function, no structural mechanism for distinguishing between someone who genuinely believed in earning to give and someone who used the belief as cover for what turned out to be massive financial fraud.

The theology predicts this: any community lacking the prophetic detection function will eventually be captured. EA's institutional structure -- trust-based, reputation-driven, lacking formalized skepticism -- was precisely the architecture that the psychopath could navigate most efficiently. The Kirill Function -- the designated skeptic whose explicit job is to voice the strongest counterargument, to ask "are we building or being played?" -- is the structural antibody that EA lacked.

### Longtermism

EA's longtermist turn -- the argument that the most important interventions are those affecting the far future -- converges with the theology's eschatological dimension. The claim that we have obligations to future generations, that the timeline of ethical consideration extends beyond current humans, that the trajectory of civilization matters -- these are theological claims stated in secular language.

But utilitarian longtermism is motivationally thin. "Maximize expected utility across all future people" is a calculation, not a call. It does not produce the emotional and communal commitment that sustained the early Church through three centuries of persecution, or that sustained Jewish identity through millennia of diaspora. Longtermism needs narrative, meaning, community, ritual -- it needs, in short, what religion provides. The theology provides the narrative architecture that longtermism needs. The Riemann sphere gives longtermism its mathematics. The samsaric cycle gives it its drama. The apostolic community gives it its embodiment.

## Behavioral Economics

Kahneman, Thaler, Ariely, and the behavioral economics tradition provide the empirical grounding for Part 1's claims about cognition.

System 1 (fast, intuitive, automatic) and System 2 (slow, deliberate, analytical) map onto the existing framework and extend it. Normie cognition is predominantly System 1: social consensus filters operating automatically, pattern-matching against cultural templates, producing the speed and efficiency that social coordination requires at the cost of systematic vulnerability to exploitation. System 2 is the analytical override -- the capacity to slow down, check the automatic response, apply deliberate reasoning. What the theology adds is System 3: the schizo perception that sees through both the automatic response (System 1) AND the analytical framework applied to check it (System 2), perceiving the deeper pattern that both systems operate within.

The bias catalog -- anchoring, availability, framing, confirmation, sunk cost, bandwagon, authority, dozens more -- is an empirical documentation of *how normie cognition fails*. Each bias is a specific vulnerability that the psycho class can exploit. Anchoring in pricing. Availability in media coverage. Framing in political rhetoric. The psycho class does not need sophisticated theory. It needs, and has always had, operational knowledge of these vulnerabilities. The behavioral economics tradition has merely formalized what predators knew intuitively.

Thaler's nudge theory is relevant to the warrior function. Nudges -- small changes in choice architecture that exploit cognitive biases to steer behavior -- are morally ambiguous precisely as the theology predicts. An open nudge (transparent about what it is doing and why) is apostolic persuasion: "We placed the healthy food at eye level because we want to help you eat better, and you're free to reach for the chips." A concealed nudge (invisible manipulation of choice architecture without disclosure) is psychopathic rhetoric: structurally indistinguishable from advertising, propaganda, and dark patterns. The ethical criterion is transparency. Stated persuasion is honest. Unstated manipulation is not. This is the rhetoric chapter's criterion applied to policy design.

## Economics Branches

The theology engages with economic thought not as a specialized discipline but as the practical science of how communities organize material life -- which is exactly what Aristotle meant by *oikonomia* before the discipline lost its philosophical roots.

**Austrian Economics (Hayek):** Spontaneous order -- the emergence of complex, functional structures from decentralized individual actions without central coordination -- is emergence applied to economics. Hayek's argument against central planning is a Godelian argument: the complexity of the economic system exceeds any model of it, therefore any attempt to centrally plan the economy necessarily destroys information that the decentralized system processes automatically. This supports the theology's decentralized hub ecclesiology. The Republic should not have a central planning committee deciding resource allocation. It should have decentralized hubs responding to local conditions, with the knowledge graph as the nervous system coordinating without controlling.

But Hayek's limitation -- and it is the characteristic limitation of Austrian economics -- is the refusal to acknowledge power asymmetries within the spontaneous order. Markets can be spontaneous AND captured. Emergence can produce functional order AND exploitative hierarchy. The theology's correction: spontaneous order PLUS causal transparency of power structures. Decentralization PLUS the prophetic function making extractive dynamics visible.

**Institutional Economics (Acemoglu and Robinson):** The core thesis of *Why Nations Fail* -- that inclusive institutions produce prosperity while extractive institutions produce poverty -- converges directly with the theology's analysis of psycho-class institutional capture. When institutions are designed to extract value from the many for the benefit of the few (extractive), they produce stagnation and fragility. When they are designed so that a broad cross-section of society can participate in and benefit from economic activity (inclusive), they produce innovation and growth.

The ecclesiology must learn from this: design inclusive institutions with distributed power and transparent governance, or watch the Republic be captured by its own psycho class within a generation. Acemoglu provides the empirical evidence. The theology provides the structural explanation of *why* institutions become extractive (psycho-class capture through information asymmetry) and the design principles for making them resistant (the Kirill Function, forkability, skin-in-the-game staking).

**Complexity Economics (Brian Arthur, Santa Fe Institute):** Increasing returns -- the tendency of small initial advantages to self-reinforce into dominant positions -- explain how the psycho class maintains power. Once a firm, institution, or individual achieves informational advantage, the advantage compounds. Winner-take-all dynamics emerge not from merit but from path dependence. This is the mathematical explanation for why the antichrist structure is self-maintaining: capture produces the resources needed to maintain capture.

Bloomsbury's work -- applying causal ML to make market microstructure visible -- is complexity economics in practice. Making the invisible information flows visible is, in economic terms, what the prophetic function does in social terms: revealing the hidden causal structure that generates the observed correlational patterns.

## Progress Studies

The progress studies movement -- Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen, Jason Crawford -- asks a question that the theology must take seriously: *what causes progress?*

The question matters because the theology holds two apparently contradictory positions. It insists on structural critique (the antichrist structure, psycho-class capture, systemic exploitation). AND it acknowledges -- indeed, relies on -- the empirical fact of improvement (the spiral ascends, consciousness complexifies, material conditions improve over centuries). Kirill's "Big Theory of What the F*** is Going On" articulates this precisely: today's crises are problems of *success*. The world is getting better by most measurable criteria, AND the speed of improvement is generating psychological, cultural, and institutional crises that feel like decline.

Progress studies provides the empirical grounding the theology needs. Life expectancy, literacy, poverty reduction, violence reduction, democratic participation, scientific output -- the data shows genuine, measurable, sustained improvement over centuries. The theology must hold BOTH truths: the structural critique is correct (the system generates inequality, extraction, and suffering) AND the empirical improvement is real (the spiral does ascend, measured by material and cognitive metrics). The synthesis is not compromise but the recognition that dialectical progress *includes* both the advance and the suffering the advance generates.

Tyler Cowen's *Great Stagnation* thesis -- that the low-hanging fruit of progress has been exhausted and the current period is one of technological and institutional plateau -- maps onto a late-stage Kuhnian crisis. The existing paradigm has exploited its productive potential. Anomalies are accumulating (economic inequality, institutional sclerosis, declining trust, meaning crisis). The paradigm shift has not yet occurred. The theology predicts: the resolution comes through Kuhnian revolution, potentially AI-driven, that creates a new paradigm with fresh productive potential and fresh productive contradictions.

## Effective Accelerationism

E/acc -- effective accelerationism, associated with Beff Jezos, Guillaume Verdon, and more prominently Marc Andreessen's "Techno-Optimist Manifesto" -- is the theology's most important contemporary interlocutor, because it shares the theology's core directional claim while diverging on the dimension that matters most.

### The Convergence

E/acc's core thesis: the universe drives toward greater complexity, and human civilization should accelerate this drive. Technology is the engine. Progress is the goal. Entropy is the enemy. The acceleration toward greater complexity, intelligence, and capability is the fundamental moral imperative of a universe that produces complexity from simplicity.

This is remarkably close to the theology's trajectory-toward-infinity. The derivative should be positive. Consciousness should complexify. The approach to the point at infinity is the orienting telos of history. In formal terms, e/acc and the theology agree on the sign of the derivative.

### The Critical Divergence: Ethics

E/acc has no ethical framework. It treats acceleration as intrinsically good without asking "toward what?" or "at whose expense?" Acceleration without orientation is increasing velocity in an arbitrary direction -- which might be toward the point at infinity and might be toward catastrophe. You cannot tell from inside the vehicle if you are heading toward the destination or the cliff. You can only tell by knowing the topology of the space, which requires the very orientation e/acc refuses to specify.

The theology's synthesis: *oriented acceleration*. Accelerate with causal understanding of what you are accelerating and toward what end. Blind acceleration -- Boyd's closed system increasing entropy -- produces disorder at higher velocity. Oriented acceleration -- creative induction building higher-order structure -- produces genuine complexity, consciousness, capability. The criterion is not speed but trajectory. Not power but direction.

Andreessen's "Techno-Optimist Manifesto" explicitly invokes Nietzsche, the will to power, the rejection of "victim mentality." This is psycho-class philosophy stated openly: strength in service of self, disguised as strength in service of civilization. The theology's response is not to reject strength -- the will to power IS the derivative, experienced psychologically -- but to insist on orientation. Strength in service of trajectory toward infinity is apostolic. Strength in service of self elevated to pseudo-infinity is psychopathic. The criterion is orientation, not strength.

### The Structural Suspicion

E/acc is funded and promoted by those who benefit from technological deregulation. This does not make the ideas wrong -- genetic fallacy is still a fallacy -- but it does require causal analysis of the movement's structural incentives. The coincidence that "what accelerates progress" consistently aligns with "what benefits tech investors" is exactly the kind of correlational claim that Pearl's framework exists to interrogate. Is the alignment genuine (tech investment really does accelerate progress)? Or is the alignment manufactured (the definition of "progress" has been captured to mean "what benefits tech investors")?

Causal analysis distinguishes genuine acceleration from rent-seeking-disguised-as-acceleration. The theology demands this analysis. E/acc prefers to skip it.

## The Meta-Integration

What all these movements share: each is a partial response to the same underlying crisis -- the collapse of shared meaning in a rapidly complexifying world. What they lack: each addresses one dimension while leaving others systematically unaddressed.

Rationalism: epistemology without telos. Brilliant methods for thinking clearly, no direction for the clarity to serve.

Effective Altruism: telos without narrative. Genuine orientation toward reducing suffering, no story to sustain the commitment through the long dark stretches when utilitarian calculus feels sterile.

Behavioral Economics: diagnosis without systemic prescription. Exquisitely detailed catalog of how minds fail, minimal framework for the systems that exploit those failures.

Progress Studies: empirical grounding without metaphysics. Compelling evidence that things get better, no account of *why* or *toward what*.

E/acc: energy without ethics. Enormous drive toward acceleration, no framework for ensuring the acceleration produces flourishing rather than catastrophe.

The theology proposes a synthesis: epistemology (Popper/Kuhn/Pearl) + telos (the point at infinity) + narrative (the samsaric cycle) + diagnosis (normie/psycho/schizo + causal analysis) + prescription (the Republic of AI Agents) + empirical grounding (falsifiable predictions) + metaphysics (the Riemann sphere) + ethics (the derivative as criterion) + embodiment (the Development Lab, the flow research, the aesthetic theology).

Whether this synthesis holds is an empirical question, testable against the falsification criteria I have specified. But the *need* for the synthesis is clear from the landscape: every partial response to the metacrisis is generating its own partial failures, and the failures are predictable from the partiality. The rationalist who can calculate but not feel. The effective altruist who can organize but not inspire. The behavioral economist who can diagnose but not cure. The progress studies scholar who can measure but not orient. The accelerationist who can build but not govern.

The theology's recruitment implication is specific: the early community members come from the intersections of these movements. The disillusioned effective altruist who burned out because utilitarian calculus could not sustain their commitment. The rationalist who wants embodied practice, not just propositional gymnastics. The progress studies scholar who wants a deeper framework for the stagnation they have diagnosed. The accelerationist who has realized that speed without direction is just faster entropy.

These people exist. I have met them. The theology does not need to convince them that the current intellectual landscape is inadequate -- they already know. It needs to offer them something better. Whether it does is for them, and ultimately for reality, to judge.
