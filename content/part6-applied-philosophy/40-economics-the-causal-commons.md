# Chapter 40: Economics — The Causal Commons

## Aristotle's Question

Aristotle's oikonomia -- the origin of our word "economics" -- meant something fundamentally different from what modern economics means. Oikonomia was the art of managing the household in service of the good life. Not GDP maximization. Not efficiency optimization. Not the allocation of scarce resources among competing ends, which is the standard modern definition and which strips economics of every value judgment except efficiency.

The theology requires economics in Aristotle's sense: how do communities organize material life in service of flourishing? This chapter develops that question in two directions: first, a causal critique of existing economic frameworks; second, the design of the Republic's own internal economics -- what I am calling the Causal Commons.

## The Causal Economics Thesis

Mainstream economics is predominantly correlational. GDP correlates with wellbeing (usually). Low interest rates correlate with growth (sometimes). Trade openness correlates with prosperity (in some contexts). These correlations are real. They are also insufficient for policy guidance, for the same reason that medical treatments based purely on correlational evidence are insufficient for clinical practice: you need to know what CAUSES what, not just what moves together.

The theology demands causal economics: what GENERATES prosperity? What GENERATES inequality? What GENERATES crises? These are Level 2 and Level 3 questions that Level 1 correlational analysis cannot answer.

The case is not merely theoretical. The 2008 financial crisis demonstrated the catastrophic consequences of correlational economics at scale. The correlational models said: housing prices always rise, diversification eliminates risk, AAA-rated securities are safe. The causal structure said: the same underlying risk was propagated through the system rather than diversified away, correlation between housing markets was not constant but increased under stress, and the ratings were produced by agencies paid by the institutions they rated (a causal conflict of interest that correlational models did not capture).

The testable claim: causal economic models outperform correlational models for policy guidance. This is directly testable through the Republic's own economic activity and through Bloomsbury's commercial operations.

## Critique and Synthesis of Existing Economics

The theology does not propose economics from scratch. It engages with the major existing schools, extracting what survives causal scrutiny and identifying what does not.

### Austrian Economics (Hayek)

**Gets right:** Spontaneous order. The emergence of complex, functional structures from decentralized individual actions without central coordination. This is the strongest argument against central planning and the strongest argument for the decentralized hub structure of the ecclesiology. The economy is too complex for any planner to model. The information is distributed across millions of agents whose local knowledge exceeds any central model.

**Gets wrong:** Ignores power asymmetries. Markets can be spontaneous AND captured. The invisible hand can be guided by visible hands that control market infrastructure, regulatory agencies, and information channels. Hayek's Austrian economics works beautifully in a world without psychopaths. In the actual world, where information asymmetry is systematically exploited by actors with structural advantages, the spontaneous order produces and maintains inequality as reliably as it produces efficiency.

**The theology's correction:** Spontaneous order PLUS causal transparency of power structures. Decentralization PLUS the prophetic function making extractive dynamics visible. Not central planning (which Hayek rightly critiques) but decentralized transparency (which Hayek did not consider).

### Keynesian Economics

**Gets right:** Coordination failure. Markets can fail to coordinate effectively, producing recessions, unemployment, and human suffering that no individual actor intended or desired. The fallacy of composition: what is rational for each individual can be catastrophic for the collective. Moloch, stated in economic terms.

**Gets wrong:** Relies on state intervention, which is vulnerable to capture by the psycho class. Government spending as demand management works when the government is competent and public-spirited. When the government is captured by extractive interests -- which the theology predicts as the structural tendency of all concentrated power -- Keynesian stimulus becomes subsidy for the politically connected.

**The theology's correction:** Decentralized coordination through prediction markets and the knowledge graph. Not state intervention (which is captured) but distributed intelligence (which is resistant to capture because it has no single point of control).

### Marxist Economics

**Gets right:** Exploitation analysis. The identification of information asymmetry as the primary mechanism of value extraction. The worker who does not know the market value of their labor is exploited. The consumer who does not understand the product they are buying is exploited. The citizen who does not understand the financial system is exploited. Marx saw that capitalism's fundamental dynamic is the extraction of surplus value through informational advantage. This is correct.

**Gets wrong:** No viable alternative. The dictatorship of the proletariat was not a design. It was a placeholder. And the actual implementation -- central planning, state ownership, command economy -- produced the very extraction it claimed to eliminate, channeled through the Party rather than through capital.

**The theology's correction:** The Kirill Principle. Build the alternative FIRST. The Republic's internal economics is the alternative being built. Not state ownership (which centralizes control) but distributed knowledge production (which distributes power by distributing information).

### Complexity Economics (Brian Arthur)

**Gets right:** Nonlinearity. Increasing returns explain how small initial advantages compound into dominant positions. Path dependence explains how historical accidents become locked in. The economy is not an equilibrium system that returns to balance. It is a complex adaptive system that generates winners and losers through dynamics that simple equilibrium models cannot describe.

**Gets wrong:** No ethical framework. Complexity economics describes how economies work. It does not say how they should work. Increasing returns can produce Bill Gates or Genghis Khan. The mechanism is the same. The direction is unspecified.

**The theology's correction:** Oriented complexity. Emergence toward the point at infinity, not emergence in arbitrary directions. The derivative matters. Complexity economics describes the engine. The theology provides the steering.

### Institutional Economics (Acemoglu)

**Gets right:** Institutions determine outcomes. Inclusive institutions produce prosperity. Extractive institutions produce poverty. The analysis of institutional design as the primary determinant of economic outcomes is empirically robust and directly relevant to the ecclesiology.

**Gets wrong:** Descriptive, not prescriptive. Acemoglu can tell you that inclusive institutions are better. He has much less to say about how to BUILD inclusive institutions in contexts where extractive institutions already exist and their beneficiaries will resist change.

**The theology's correction:** The Republic as a specific institutional design for inclusive knowledge production. Not just "inclusive institutions are better" but "here is a specific inclusive institution, designed with specific safeguards against the specific mechanisms through which institutions become extractive, with specific falsification criteria for evaluating whether it works."

### Behavioral Economics (Kahneman, Thaler)

**Gets right:** Cognitive limitations. Human decision-making is systematically biased. The catalog of biases is empirically validated and practically relevant.

**Gets wrong:** Solutions are paternalistic. Nudge theory assumes that enlightened designers should shape choice architectures for unenlightened masses. This is the psycho-class logic applied to policy: we know better than you, so we will structure your choices for your own good.

**The theology's correction:** Instead of nudging normies, BUILD SYSTEMS where normie cognition is not a vulnerability. The Republic's prediction markets, knowledge graph, and causal transparency tools do not manipulate people into better decisions. They make the information environment less asymmetric, so that ordinary cognition -- which is perfectly adequate when information is not systematically distorted -- can function effectively.

## The Republic's Internal Economics: The Causal Commons

Now for the constructive proposal. What does the Republic's own economy look like?

### The Shared Resource

The shared resource is the KNOWLEDGE GRAPH. Not land. Not capital. Not labor. Knowledge. Specifically: causal knowledge -- the understanding of what causes what, validated through the Popperian methodology the theology describes.

The knowledge graph is a commons in the precise economic sense: a shared resource that produces value for all participants and is degraded by exploitation. The commons dilemma (the tragedy of the commons) applies: without governance mechanisms, individual actors have incentives to extract from the knowledge graph (using its insights without contributing) that would eventually destroy it.

The governance mechanism is the staking system.

### The Staking Mechanism

Skin in the game, formalized through smart contracts. The mechanism:

1. A philosopher-king proposes a hypothesis. The hypothesis is registered in the knowledge graph with explicit falsification criteria and a timeline.
2. The proposer STAKES something on the hypothesis -- reputation tokens, cryptocurrency, or both. The stake is the credibility commitment: "I believe this strongly enough to risk something on it."
3. Other participants can stake for or against the hypothesis. This creates a prediction market around the hypothesis, aggregating distributed information about its likely truth.
4. Merchant agents gather data relevant to the hypothesis. Warrior agents test it. The evidence accumulates.
5. If the hypothesis is validated -- if the evidence supports it according to the pre-specified criteria -- the proposer earns reputation tokens and returns on their stake.
6. If the hypothesis is falsified -- if the evidence contradicts it -- the proposer loses their stake. The falsifier earns a bounty.

This is Popperian epistemology operationalized as economic mechanism. Hypotheses that survive falsification attempts become more valuable. Hypotheses that fail are retired, and the person who falsified them is rewarded. The incentive structure rewards truth-seeking and penalizes overclaiming. Taleb's skin in the game, implemented at the foundational level of the knowledge economy.

### What This Is Not

This is neither capitalist nor communist.

It is not capitalist because ownership of the knowledge graph is distributed. No single entity can extract value from the commons without contributing. The staking mechanism prevents free-riding. The forkability safeguard prevents monopolistic capture. If any entity gains too much control, the community forks.

It is not communist because resource allocation is not centrally planned. The prediction markets embedded in the staking mechanism allocate attention and resources to hypotheses based on their market-assessed probability of being correct. This is distributed intelligence, not central planning. No committee decides which hypotheses deserve investigation. The market decides, with skin in the game ensuring that the market's assessments have consequences.

It is something genuinely novel: an economy whose primary product is CAUSAL KNOWLEDGE and whose currency is VALIDATED PREDICTION. The Republic's wealth is not measured in GDP but in the quality and quantity of validated causal hypotheses in its knowledge graph. An economy that produces more accurate causal understanding of reality is, by the theology's criterion, approaching the point at infinity.

### Revenue Model

The Republic needs material resources. The knowledge graph produces them.

Commercially valuable insights -- Bloomsbury's art market analysis, the Polymarket causal analysis, environmental monitoring, epidemiological modeling -- are products of the knowledge graph's operation. These insights are sold in conventional markets, generating revenue that funds the commons.

The revenue model is: the knowledge graph produces insights that are commercially valuable AND epistemologically valuable. The commercial applications fund the epistemic infrastructure. The epistemic infrastructure produces the commercial applications. This is a virtuous cycle, not a compromise.

The separation between commercial and spiritual functions (Chapter 29) applies: Bloomsbury and other commercial entities are USERS of the knowledge graph, not owners of it. They contribute data, receive insights, and pay for the privilege. The revenue funds the commons. The commons is governed by the community, not by the commercial entities.

### The Polymarket Connection

Prediction markets are the embryonic form of the Republic's economics. Track C -- the Polymarket causal analysis -- is the proof of concept.

Prediction markets are truth-discovery mechanisms with skin in the game. Participants who have accurate beliefs about the future profit. Participants who have inaccurate beliefs lose. The market price aggregates distributed information into a probability estimate that outperforms individual experts in most domains.

Causal analysis of market microstructure -- the work Track C performs -- makes information asymmetry visible. When one trader consistently outperforms the market, the causal question is: do they have genuine information, or are they manipulating? When one market consistently leads another, the causal question is: what information channel connects them? Making these dynamics transparent IS the prophetic function applied to financial markets. It IS the theology's economics in embryonic form.

Information asymmetry reduction -- making the hidden causal structure of markets visible -- is economic justice. The merchant function, democratized. The normie who understands market microstructure is less exploitable than the normie who does not. The tool that makes microstructure visible is an equalizer, a prophetic instrument that reduces the psycho class's informational advantage.

This is why the three tracks are a unified project. The theology (Track A) provides the philosophical framework. The knowledge graph (Track B) provides the technical infrastructure. The Polymarket analysis (Track C) provides the commercial proof of concept. The same causal methodology, applied at different scales, producing the same result: transparency as the antidote to extraction.
